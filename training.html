<p><strong>Requesting  a Regional Workshop</strong></p>
    <p>If 10 or more individuals from one or more academic institutions  in the U.S. are willing to host a training workshop at a single location, then  MGAN workshop facilitators will come to your location. During the academic  year, we typically offer a 1 day (Saturday) or 1- 1/2 day (Saturday &amp;  Sunday) workshop. However, other formats can be negotiated, especially if the  workshop is offered over the summer or during an institutional break.<br>
      <br>
      There are a limited number of regional workshops each year. Priority will be  given to requests that have the greatest student and faculty impact, involve  institutions with high underrepresented minority student populations, community  college, and/or a network of institutions.</p>
    <p> All travel and room and board costs for the MGAN trainers are  covered by MGAN.<br>
      <br>
      For most regional workshops, the hosting institution must supply an on-campus  computer lab or a facility with Wifi access, at least 10 attendees, and a  primary contact person to assist the MGAN trainers with the logistical  arrangements (<em>e.g.,</em>&nbsp;hotel  and directions). If an institution does not have a suitable computer lab, then  moving the venue to a nearby conferencing facility with Wifi capability is an  option that can be discussed with the National MGAN Office.<br>
    </p>
